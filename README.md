# Mountain-Hero

Mountain Hero, at it's core, is a memory based spatial puzzle. You play as a mountain   climber who is navigating their way to a peak during a whiteout blizzard. Along the way, you need several different types of tools. Specific tools must be used at specific spots on the mountain for you to successfully reach the peak.
  
Upon starting a level, the player is able to see which of their tools (peg, ice screw, anchor, or rock tensioner) needs to be used and in which spaces. However, the moment a player takes their first step, they are blinded by the blizzard. All of the visual information regarding where tools should be used and where is gone. A player must rely on their memory to succesfully use their tools in the correct spots and thus take the correct path to the peak. 
  
Though this project was always meant to have a mountain climbing theme, it was initially supposed to be a rhythm based game similar to guitar hero in a way. However, upon learning more about puzzlescript (which this was developed in), I quickly realized that the mechanics of such a game would be next to impossible (at least at my skill level) in the engine. I changed it to a memory based spatial puzzle game because of this, and the core themes of my initial pitch (matching specific gear to specific terrain) was preserved.

**Mechanics & Controls**

Movement: Arrow keys or WASD
ACTION (cycle through tools): X
Undo Move: Z

The core mechanic of this game is the whiteout blizzard. Before moving, the players can see the "targets" representing terrain and what tool to use in that spot. These disappear upon movement, but the player must use their tools correctly in terms of both which tool and location for the win condition to be met. 
  
Ancillary Mechanics and choice idiom in this game are achieved through the cycling of tools. The player must use the action button to cycle through their tools. Pressing action cycles through the tools, placing them at the current location of the player, in this order:
  1. Pegs
  2. Ice Screws
  3. Anchors
  4. Rock Tensioners
  
The interaction between the core mechanic of "blinding" the player and the ancillary mechanics (cycling tools) creates the core puzzle of this game. Where do you go, and what tool do you place when you get there?
